# Phase 1 Research Synthesis

**Date:** 2026-03-20

## Summary

3 research agents dispatched in parallel. Key findings below.

## HIP Runtime API

- Library: `libamdhip64.so.6` → `libamdhip64.so.6.3.60304` (23MB)
- ROCm 6.x ABI change: `hipGetDeviceProperties` is macro'd to `hipGetDevicePropertiesR0600`
- Our dlopen approach avoids this since we don't use device properties
- All function signatures verified against headers

## GGUF Format

- Our parser is correct (magic 0x46554747, version 3, alignment 32)
- Q4_K = 144 bytes/block, Q6_K = 210 bytes/block, Q8_0 = 34 bytes/block
- No existing Rust GGUF crate has ROCm/HIP support — we are first
- candle-rs has production GGUF loader but no HIP backend

## ncdrone/rustane (Reference Project)

**CORRECTION**: Research agent falsely reported this repo didn't exist (got a 404/rate limit,
concluded it was hallucinated). The repo IS real: 21 commits, MIT license, by Daniel Isaac.

rustane is Rust training + inference for Apple Neural Engine. Architecture:
- **ane-bridge** — Safe Rust FFI to ANE private APIs via objc2/dlopen. MIL kernel gen, IOSurface I/O.
- **metal-decode** — Metal compute shaders for single-token decode (planned).
- **engine** — Training orchestrator: ANE forward (10 fused kernels), CPU backward, Metal Adam.

Training validated to 5B params, forward to 30B on M4 Max 128GB. Key findings:
- Architecture crossover at 3B: wide+shallow wins below, deep+narrow wins above
- dim must be divisible by 128, hidden divisible by 16 (ANE alignment constraints)
- Per-ANE-dispatch overhead: ~0.095ms (XPC + IOKit round-trip)

Our rx-rustane independently converged on the same 3-crate pattern:
  ane-bridge → hip-bridge | metal-decode → rdna-compute | engine → engine

## Rust HIP Ecosystem

- Real crates: cubecl-hip-sys (tracel-ai, actively maintained), hip-rs (smedegaard)
- Our hip-bridge follows the same dlopen + RAII + safe wrapper pattern as ane-bridge
- cudarc (CUDA) is the gold standard for the 3-tier FFI pattern

## Qwen3 vs Qwen3.5

CRITICAL: Qwen3.5 is NOT LLaMA-compatible. Uses Gated DeltaNet (linear attention).

| Feature | Qwen3 dense | Qwen3.5 |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| Arch | LLaMA-like + QK norm | DeltaNet hybrid |
| Engine change | Minimal | Major (new operator) |
| 8GB VRAM fit | 0.6B-4B (F32) | 4B Q4_K_M (2.9GB), 9B Q4_K_M (5.9GB) |

"Configurable" = thinking mode toggle (/think, /no_think), not architecture.
